### 🚗 Car Rental Cost Calculator (Java)

This project is a Java-based Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) simulation for a car rental system. It calculates the total rental cost based on the car's transmission type and the duration of the rental.

**Features:**
* Takes car details dynamically from the user via console input (Brand, year, daily price, transmission type).
* Adds a fixed additional fee for automatic transmission cars.
* Applies a 10% dynamic discount if the rental period exceeds 7 days.
* Displays cleanly formatted vehicle and rental information.

**Tech Stack:**
* Java
* OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Methods)
* `java.util.Scanner` for console inputs
